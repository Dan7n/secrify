# Secrify



A simple application that allows you to store and share encrypted secrets (passwords, env variables, messages, etc.) via a simple URL. 

All secrets you created are encrypted data using a secure AES 256-bit algorithm - the same algorithm used by government agencies to store classified or sensitive information.

This project was created using Sveltekit as a way for me to learn the framework (and I have to say I'm in love ❤️)
